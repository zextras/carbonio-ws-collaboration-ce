```

If you also want to generate all artifacts, run

```shell
mvn clean install -P artifacts
```

---
If you want to generate only the artifact for a specific distro

```shell
mvn clean install -P artifacts -D distro=<1>
```

Where

1. distro value is the distro name (ubuntu or rocky-8)

----
If you want to generate only the artifact for a specific distro and deploy it in
a test server

```shell
mvn clean install -P artifacts -D distro=<1> -D deployOn=<2> -D debugMode=<3>
```

Where

1. distro value is the distro name (ubuntu or rocky-8)
2. deployOn value is the domain name or IP of the server to deploy the artifact
3. debugMode is a boolean value to indicate whether the installed Chat
   environment should have the debug port active

There's also a `noDocker` option which will build artifacts using a local pacur
instance instead of using the docker image, which is useful for CI pipeline.
